# Travel-website

My Very First Travel Website.

- the _website_ : https://tripembark.com/
  It's which i'm upgrading it.

- will try to do various things....

### Things that I noticed while browsing these websiteâ€¦

1. Navbar can be improve.

   1. Such as I can make it sticky, And have morph effect.

   â†’ Home, Blog, About, Contact.

2. Then a **Section**, that have 2 partition ðŸ‘‡
   1. One , that contains _some text_(introductory) and email for join up our regular sending mailâ€¦
   2. Other one, contains a image.

â†’ Here, I was thinking rather than having just plane partition, we can have a video running in that _section_ and can have _transparent_ effect, and _some introductory text_â€¦

1. Then comes **Latest Post** section,
   1. Which contains lots of posts.

â†’ Here, I was thinking of improving UI experience, something interesting to watch and look at. ( This thing in pending !? ðŸ¤”)

1. Footer
   1. In footer, There is full section of it, with partition, There, is logo and some text regarding company, and links to various pages, and again _Join_ letter.
